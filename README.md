# BackwardsBot

Bot to torment a random Twitter user by replying to their Tweet with the same content, but spelled backwards.

Necessities:
* Python (I think every version will do, but I used 3.9.2)
* Tweepy (Install by using "pip install tweepy" in Powershell)
* IDLE will do, but why would you?
* Don't be an idiot and know a bit of Python
